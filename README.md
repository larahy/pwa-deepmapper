# Deepmapper Project Front End.

Deepmapper is a Progressive Web App (PWA) and the basic unit of the app is the "placecast" - a short podcast (under 10 minutes) with GPS coordinates attached to it. 
The GPS coordinates anchor each placecast to a specific place or building in the real world. 
The content of each placecast will therefore be about that specific building or place - a history, story, a description, etc. 
Placecasts are generated by expert users (academics, writers) via the app. 
Placecasts can be listened to by anyone, either remotely (via laptop or smartphone), or locally at the actual place in question (via smartphone).
